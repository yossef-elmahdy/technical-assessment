# Quality and Versioning Mechanisms
At this point, we need to establish mechanisms to ensure the quality of data whenever new data is added on a periodic basis (daily, weekly, monthly, ...etc). 

Also, we need to make sure of keeping the history of the data and any changes can happen on it, this can be acheived by ***logging*** for any create, update or delete of data records. 

## Data Quality Management
We can use several methods or implemntations to make sure that the quality of data is acceptable based on our defined criteria: 
1. **Implement Constraints and Checks:** As we did for our data, I've used constraints like (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY) and other data validation checks (e.g., CHECK constraints, triggers) to enforce data quality rules at the database level. This ensures that incoming data meets predefined criteria.

2. **Regular Data Quality Checks:** Schedule regular data quality checks to monitor adherence to defined metrics and identify any anomalies or discrepancies.

3. **Data Profiling:** Use data profiling techniques to analyze your data and gain insights into its characteristics, such as value distributions, outliers, missing values, and data patterns.



## Data Versioning
It is important to keep the history of data, track any changes happened to it and keep the knoweldege of who are responsible for these changes. This can be called ***logging***. 

We can use triggers to achieve this. 

1. **Create Versioning Tables:** Create tables to store the historical versions of your dataset. You may need separate tables for the main dataset and its historical versions.

2. **Trigger-based Approach:** Use triggers to automatically capture changes made to the main dataset table and insert them into the versioning tables.

3. **Timestamps and Metadata:** Include timestamps and metadata columns in the versioning tables to track when changes were made and by whom
